# Implement privacy feature

## Abstract
QRL currently has no privacy features. This means ***every transaction can be followed through the blockchain***. The identity of the original wallet holder can be revealed this way by for example tracing the transaction back to KYC required exchanges.

## Motivation
QRL adding privacy features will most likely attract a new target audience: privacy conscious people.

***Edward Snowden: "Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say"***

## Implementation
Privacy as an optional feature is no privacy at all. This is why we need privacy as a must. This will most likely require a hardfork. See Monero's privacy features. Continued to be discussed with the community & team.

## Considirations
Bittrex doesn't allowed privacy coins, this means QRL will be removed from Bittrex. We have to find alternative exchanges.

Other exchange(s):
Binance, Tradeogre, Uniswap or other decentralized exchanges.
